The user gets a total of five attempts to guess a five letter word.
When the user makes a guess, the background color of a letter will change to either green, yellow or
grey. Green indicates that the letter is in the word and in the correct spot. Yellow indicates that the
letter is in the word but is not in the correct location and grey indicates that the letter is not in the word at all

Input:
All input for this GUI will come from listening to keystrokes. Any time a letter is inputted, panels within
a row will update from left to right. 
Once five letters have been inputted, any additional letters will be
ignored until the user submits their word as a guess. Initially the top row is filled in. After they submit a
guess, then row 1 is filled in and so forth.
If the user presses the backspace key, then their most recently entered letter will be erased and pressing
a letter will fill in the location of the most recently deleted letter. Backspace key input should be
discarded if no letters are present within the current row.
When the user presses the enter key, they are signaling that they want to submit all five letters from the
current row of input as a guess. If they press the enter key prior to five letters being inputted within the
current row, it should simply be ignored (discarded). If the userâ€™s guess is not a real 5 letter word, a
message box should pop up informing them and that word should not be submitted as a guess.
When the user submits a guess that is a real word, you will convert the panels in that row to either
green, yellow or grey as described above.
If the user guesses the word correctly, the key listener should be removed to indicate that no additional attempts
are allowed
