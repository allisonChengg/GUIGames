Classic game of Snake
A snake continuously moves around the board facing a given direction. 
Any time the user presses the up, down, left or right arrow on the keyboard, the snake
changes direction. Different images are combined in adjacent panels to represent the snake.

When the snake moves, the location next to the head (in the direction the snake is facing) should now 
have the head. Where the head used to be should now contain the neck and so on for the rest of the body.

An image will be randomly generated anywhere on the board as long as the space is not occupied by the snake.

When the snake “eats” the apple, the snake grows one size larger. In this case a brand
new apple should be randomly placed on the board.

The game is over if the head of the snake runs out of bounds or touches any part of its body.
